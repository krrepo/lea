<h1>Credits</h1>

I thank Guido van Rossum and Python community. Python is such an <i>amazing</i> programming language!<br>
<br>
I thank Gilles Scouvart, who provided insights on the design of Lea classes and who brought seminal ideas on conditional probabilities.<br>
<br>
I thank <a href='http://nicky.vanforeest.com/'>Nicky van Foreest</a>, who gave precious feedbacks to improve the package, including an <i>outstanding</i> algorithm to speed up min / max functions. I express my gratitude to Nicky, who has been an early adopter and advocate of Lea.<br>
<br>
I thank Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig for their great book "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach", which contains inspiring chapters on probabilities, for having given me their permissions to use the examples of their book.<br>
<br>
I thank <a href='http://www.n-side.com/'>n-Side</a> (my company) for having given me the opportunity to present the Lea module at the traditional "Thursday's Lunch".<br>
<br>
I thank Google for <a href='https://code.google.com/'>Google Code</a>, which nicely hosts Lea project.<br>
<br>
I thank my old fellow Gino D'Acquisto, who made English proofing on some parts of the documentation.<br>
<br>
I thank my dear children, Corentin and Lauréline, who gave all their support, without knowing too much what <i>discrete probability</i> is about!<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Dedication</h1>

I dedicate this work to my aunt, Dr. Janine Kint (1922-1986), who transmitted me her passion to Mathematics and who lent me her book about probabilities some 30 years ago.<br>
